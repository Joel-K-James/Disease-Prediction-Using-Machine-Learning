# Disease Prediction using Machine Learning
The goal of this project is to predict diseases based on patient symptoms using machine learning. The script handles missing values, normalizes features, addresses class imbalance using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), and evaluates model performance using various metrics. Additionally, the feature importance of the model is analyzed and visualized.
### Dataset
The dataset used for this project is Disease Symptoms Dataset, which contains various symptoms as features and diseases as the target variable.

- Source: The dataset can be found on Kaggle: Disease Symptoms Dataset.
- Structure: Each row represents a patient, with columns for various symptoms (binary indicators) and the target variable disease.

Make sure to download the dataset and place the Training.csv file in the project directory before running the script.

### Models Used
Logistic Regression
You can easily add other models such as Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Random Forest by modifying the models dictionary in the script.

### Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy: The ratio of correct predictions to the total number of predictions.
Precision: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total positive predictions.
Recall: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positive cases.
F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
## Output
### Accuracy: 1.0000
### Precision: 1.0000
### Recall: 1.0000
### F1-score: 1.0000
